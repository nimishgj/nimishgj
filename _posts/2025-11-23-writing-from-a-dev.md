# One shot answer
For me, yes, It doesn't apply to every person


## How it Started
When I first started my job as a developer, I started looking at what other developers
do in their free time
— their hobbies, their GitHub repos, the kinds of side projects they maintained.
A lot of them had dotfiles, personal websites, small projects, and blog sites.
So I started exploring what the "best-looking" blog websites looked like.
I found a few I liked and simply copied all the blogs I had written at my
company into that website.

I felt good that I also had a blog site. I bragged about it for a while…
and then I never looked at it again.

## What I Realized later
During all of this, the most important question I never asked was: why?

Why do people have their own blog websites?
I started asking around and got different answers — "It's cool," "To showcase my work,"
"To understand myself better."

That made me think: How would it help me?
At that point, I didn't care about being cool. I wanted something meaningful.

So I started writing about different topics and slowly realized that it helped me
understand my own thoughts more clearly. Writing made my thinking sharper.
It helped me convey what was in my head to others. It improved my communication and writing skills.

That's when it clicked — writing wasn't for showcasing. It was for clarity.

## My take on why to write or why to document
When we think about a problem or scenario, we often miss cases or misunderstand the problem.
But when we take a pen and paper and start writing, we automatically begin asking ourselves questions:

- "Oh, what if this happens?"
- "Is this even important?"
- "Will this help in solving the issue?"

Writing clears the mind. It forces us to understand what we want to achieve
and how we even landed in the situation.

It may not always set us on the perfect path, but it definitely helps us
understand the problem or topic better — which is the first step to solving it.

## Difficulties with writing regularly
At some point I wanted to write and express and showcase my skills, but I kept
giving the reason that I didn't have time.
The Real reason was fear.

I was worried about what people would think of me.
What if my blog wasn't good?
What if people judged me?

This stopped me from writing for a long time,
But here's the truth: We all have to start somewhere
No one is a born expert
Your early blogs may not make sense to everyone.
They may not be perfectly written. But if you don't start, nothing will happen.

Write about anything. Get help if needed. There are many people who feel exactly the same way.
You might even connect with them. And you might help someone struggling with the same fear.

> I am also starting to write at least one blog a week.
