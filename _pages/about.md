Hey there!

I'm Nimisha, a DevOps Engineer based in Bangalore. I spend most of my time building observability platforms and cloud infrastructure at [Infraspec](https://infraspec.dev).

I like building things that make developers' lives easier — CLI tools, monitoring solutions, infrastructure that just works. My current obsession is OpenTelemetry and making sense of distributed systems. Before that, it was Kubernetes. Before that, it was figuring out why my Arch Linux install broke (again).

I write here to make sense of what I learn. Sometimes the best way to understand something is to explain it to someone else. If you find something useful, that's a bonus.

When I'm not staring at terminals, you might find me tinkering with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nimishgj/dotfiles) (it's a rabbit hole, I know), out on a bike ride, lost in a book, or gaming. I'm also currently trying to learn bowling — it's harder than it looks.

## Stuff I've built

Some side projects I've been working on — mostly scratching my own itches:

- [tmi](https://github.com/nimishgj/tmi) — got tired of setting up tmux sessions manually, so I made this
- [cpbrd](https://github.com/nimishgj/cpbrd) — a clipboard manager because I kept losing things I copied
- [otel-collector-contrib-config](https://github.com/nimishgj/otel-collector-contrib-config) — configs I use for OpenTelemetry, figured others might find them useful
- [network-boot-raspberry-pi](https://github.com/nimishgj/network-boot-raspberry-pi) — because flashing SD cards for every Pi got old real fast
